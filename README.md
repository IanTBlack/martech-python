# martech-python
martech-python is a set of modules that I regularly use to perform quality conformance tests on sensors and packages received from vendors after servicing.


## Dependencies
The only non-native Python 3 package that is utilized by these modules is PySerial.
To install PySerial...

`pip install pyserial`

## Sensors

Modules for the following sensors can be found here.


**Sea-Bird Scientific ECO Triplet-w**
